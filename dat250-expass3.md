# Software Technology Experiment 3

## Installation and verification

I experienced no technical problems during installation. When verifying the installation I encountered an error at step 4 which I didn't figure out how to solve. I asked in the expass discussion forum on Canvas as well, but did not receive any replies. Using the SHA verification instead was successful.
